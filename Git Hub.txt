git init            :-    It is used to create a ".git" hidden file in the project folder. (It is an empty git file)
                            It is used to initialize the local repository. 

git config --global user.name "GitHub USERNAME"  :- 
                           This command is used to set up the user name for that git Hub repository. 
                           We need to pass the username of the git account where we are trying to push our code. 

git config --global user.email "GitHub EMAIL"   :- 
                          This command is used to set up the email for that git Hub repository. 
                           We need to pass the email which is linked with that git hub account. 
 
git status  :- This command is used to show the files which are Tracked and the files which are not Tracked.
