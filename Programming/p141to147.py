# 141 What is the difference between a module, a package, and a library
#            1. A module is simply a Python file thatâ€™s intended to be imported into scripts or other modules.
#               It contains functions, classes, and global variables.

#  2. A package is a collection of modules that are grouped together inside a folder to provide consistent
#     functionality. Packages can be imported just like modules. They usually have an __init__.py file in them.

#    3. A library is a collection of packages.
